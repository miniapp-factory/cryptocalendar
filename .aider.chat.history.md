#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two places:

1. **`mini-app/lib/metadata.ts`** – update the `title` and `description` values to match the new app description.  
2. **`mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`** – create a new file that specifies the logo size and a detailed description for the image generator.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for that file. Once that’s added, I’ll also give you the block to create the new `logo.png.todo` file.

A stylized calendar icon with a digital coin overlay, set against a dark blue background. The calendar shows a grid of days with a highlighted date featuring a glowing coin symbol. The coin has a subtle gradient from gold to silver, and the calendar grid lines are thin white. The overall design conveys technology and finance, with a clean, modern aesthetic. The background is a deep navy blue, giving contrast to the bright gold coin. The logo should be clear and recognizable at small sizes, with a simple, bold style.
